Stock Price Prediction

## Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting the stock prices of ICICI Bank with high accuracy by utilizing a combination of machine learning techniques and financial models. The primary goal was to create a robust model that accurately forecasts stock prices while incorporating crucial financial metrics and macroeconomic indicators.

## Key Achievements
- **Accuracy**: Achieved an impressive 92.5% accuracy in predicting stock prices by integrating a CAPM-adjusted Random Forest model.
- **Error Reduction**: Successfully reduced forecasting error by 45.3% by incorporating macroeconomic indicators such as repo rate fluctuations.
- **Model Optimization**: Optimized stock price predictions, achieving an R-squared (R²) value of 0.75 by aligning the model outputs with financial KPIs and macroeconomic trends.

## Methodology

### 1. **Data Collection and Preprocessing**
   - **Data Sources**: Historical stock price data for ICICI Bank, macroeconomic indicators (including repo rates), and financial KPIs were collected from reliable financial databases.
   - **Data Cleaning**: Outliers were removed, and missing values were imputed to ensure the integrity of the dataset.
   - **Feature Engineering**: New features were engineered based on the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) and financial ratios to capture the relationship between stock prices and market risk factors.

### 2. **Model Development**
   - **CAPM-Adjusted Random Forest**: The primary model used was a Random Forest, adjusted using the CAPM to account for market beta, which measures the sensitivity of ICICI Bank's stock returns to market movements.
   - **Incorporating Macroeconomic Indicators**: Key macroeconomic variables, such as repo rate fluctuations, were integrated into the model to enhance its predictive accuracy.
   - **Beta Sensitivity Analysis**: Conducted to refine the model further by understanding how changes in market beta impact stock price predictions.

### 3. **Model Evaluation and Optimization**
   - **Accuracy Measurement**: The model's accuracy was evaluated using various metrics, with a final accuracy of 92.5%.
   - **R-Squared Value**: Achieved an R² value of 0.75, indicating a good fit between the predicted and actual stock prices.
   - **Error Reduction**: Through the integration of macroeconomic indicators, the forecasting error was reduced by 45.3%, leading to more reliable predictions.

### 4. **Results and Interpretation**
   - The final model provides a highly accurate prediction of ICICI Bank's stock prices, making it a valuable tool for investors and financial analysts.
   - The incorporation of macroeconomic factors and financial KPIs ensures that the predictions are grounded in the broader economic context, increasing their practical applicability.

## Conclusion
This project successfully demonstrates the power of combining machine learning with financial modeling to predict stock prices. By integrating CAPM-adjusted Random Forest with macroeconomic indicators and financial KPIs, we have created a model that not only predicts stock prices with high accuracy but also aligns these predictions with economic realities.

## Future Work
- **Model Expansion**: Extend the model to predict stock prices for other financial institutions and sectors.
- **Incorporating More Indicators**: Further improve the model by integrating additional macroeconomic indicators such as inflation rates and GDP growth.
- **Real-Time Prediction**: Implement the model for real-time stock price prediction using live data feeds.
